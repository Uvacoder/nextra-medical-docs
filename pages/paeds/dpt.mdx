# Diphtheria
Diphtheria is an acute bacterial infection caused by gram positive bacillus *Corynebacterium diphtheriae*.

## Microbiology
*C. diphtheriae* is a gram positive club shaped bacillus with a beaded end. The beads at the end contains metachromatic granules. It is also known as Klebs Loeffler bacillus. Major virulent factor is **Exotoxin A** and B. There also some other factors like cell wall components O and K antigens, which share a role in the pathogenesis. Actually, *C. diptheriae* is a commensal of the upper respiratory tract and are non toxigenic in nature. Only toxigenic varieties are capable of causing diphtheria. Toxigenicity is acquired by the bacteria when they are infected (lysogenized) by the so-called corynebacteriophage viruses followed by the transfer of the *tox* gene from the virus into the bacteria. Based on the colonial morphology and biochemical properties, there are 4 biotypes for *C. diptheriae* - gravis, intermedius, mitis and belfanti.

## Epidemiology
Incubation period: 2 - 5 days
More common in children of 3 to 5 years of age, since younger children are protected by immunisation and immunity gradually diminishes over age. It is also more commonly encountered in cold seasons like winter and autumn. It commonly spreads by contact and droplet transmission.

## Pathogenesis
Diptheria toxin causes inhibition of protien synthesis within cells and tissue necrosis. This leads to inflammatory changes within the tissue causing serous and fibrinous discharge which eventually forms a pseudomembrane. A pseudomembrane lacks the normal histologic structure of a membrane. It is but a collection of inflammatory debris along with fibrin. The psuedomembrane on dislodging causes bleeding.
The toxin has also effects on the heart and kidney. In the heart it can cause toxic myocarditis (cardiomegaly, congestive cardiac failure and arrhythmia) and in kidney it can cause oliguria and proteinuria.
Neurological effects of the toxin include paralysis of the palatal muscles, ocular palsy, generalizes polyneuritis.

## Clinical features
- Child presents sick and toxic
- Fever and malaise
- Clouded sensorium
- Circulatory insufficiency

### Local manifestations
- Nasal diphtheria -> serosanguinous discharge
- Faucial diphtheria -> hyperemia and swelling of pharynx, pseudomembrane.
- Bull neck appearance -> Enlarged lymph nodes in the neck and lymphadenopathy
- laryngotracheal - noisy breathing and hoarse voice
- cutaneous - punched out ulcers
- conjunctival - yellowish discharge

## Complications
- Toxic myocarditis - charecterised by cardiomegaly and white shadows in the radiograph
- Toxic neuropathy - palatall paralysis, charecterised by uvula deviation to the contralateral side, loss of accommodation reflex and polyneuropathy. 
- Renal tubular necrosis

## Diagnosis
- Clinical examination
- isolation of bacilli - Albert stain and Culture in Loeffler medium
- Ancilliary investigations - to rule out other DDs of membrane over tonsil and to rule out complications (Renal - urine protien levels, urine output; Cardiac - chest radiograph, ECG, Polyneuropathy - Nerve conduction study)

## Treatment
i. Antidephtheritic serum:
    - nasal diphtheria - 20,000 units IV/IM
    - faulcial diphtheria - 40,000 units IV/IM
    - laryngotracheal diphtheria - 80,000 to 1,20,000 units IV/IM
ii. Diphtheria immunoglobulin (Ig) : 0.6 ml/kg
iii. Antibiotics:
    - Penicillin G - 1 to 1.5 Lakh units/kg/day x 14 days
    - Erythromycin - 40 to 50 mg/kg/day x 14 days
    - Azithromycin:
        - if < 6 months
