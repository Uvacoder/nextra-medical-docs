# Enteric Fever

## Microbiology
- Comprises of typhoid and paratyphoid
- Causative agent - *Salmonella Typhi* and *S. paratyphi* A(more dangerous) and B
- Spread through contaminated food and water (feco-oral)

## Pathogenesis
- Once in the body the bacteria affects the Payer's patches of the intestine and also gets itself stored in the gall bladder from which it is released intermittently causing intermittent spikes of fever.

## Clinical Features
- High spiking fever, gastroenteritis and Hepatosplenomegaly (common in older children)
- relative bradycardia. (tachycardia which is not upto the mark as expected with that level of fever)
- sick looking child (its a term pediatricians use. it takes practice to identify a sick looking child)
- coated toungue, tympanitic abdomen, rose spots (Seen in Caucasians. Hard to make out in Indian skin tone)
- Anorexia, malaise, headache, diarrhea, constipation, blah, blah
- rarely the child may encounter delirium

## Complications
- The most feared complications of Enteric fever are Encephalopathy and Endotoxic shock
- intestinal perforation and hemorrhage
- CNS Complications
    - Guillain-Barre syndrome
    - Transverse myelitis
    - Aphasia
    - Deafness
    - Psychosis
- pyelonephritis
- Meningoencephalitis (encephalitis means the agent directly attacking the brain causing inflammation but Encephalopathy means damage to the brain caused by toxins or chemicals. For example: hepatic encephalopathy)
- shock and AKI

## Investigations
- Leukocytosis or Leukopenia(more common)
- thrombocytopenia
- AST/ALT is elevated without jaundice (Anicteric hepatitis)
- Blood Culture (more likely to be positive in the 1st week. Anyway it's the gold standard)
- S.Widal (considered positive if O or H titers > 1:160)
- Bone marrow aspirate culture (if nothing else helps)
- Typhidot IgM ELISA

## Treatment
- 3rd Gen Cephalosporins
    - IV - Ceftriaxone or Cefotaxime
    - Oral - High dose Cefixime 20mg/kg/day (usual dose is 10mg/kg/day)
- Azithromycin - 2nd line drug (given only in uncomplicated patients. Don't put your trust on azithro's efficacy in a complicated case)
- Aztreonam and Imipenem (given if there is no response even after 7 days)
- (Don't give FQs. its resistant with a high MIC. If you can't live without one, then Ofloxacin is relatively better)
> Antibiotics are given till 7 days following defervescence of fever or for 14 days, whichever is longer
- IV Dexamethasone is given in case of coma or encephalopathy (3mg/kg stat followed by 1mg/kg 6hrly for 48 hrs)
- Paracetamol (not given > 60 mg/kg/day)
- hydration and tepid sponging

## Prevention
- clean food and water (avoid cut fruits kept open for a long time)
- vaccine - Typhim Vi polysaccharide vaccine (has an efficacy of 50% to 70% for upto 3 years and can also reduce the impact if infected)

> ## Approach to Fever with Hepatosplenomegaly
> | Infections | Malignancy | Autoimmune disorders |
> | ------ | ------- | ------- |
> | Enteric Fever | Leukemia | SLE |
> | Malaria | Lymphoma | Kawasaki disease |
> | Scrub typhus | | Juvenille idipathic arthritis |
> | Leptospirosis | | |
> | Tuberculosis | | |

> HSM without fever is seen in glycogen storage disorders and hemolytic anemias
